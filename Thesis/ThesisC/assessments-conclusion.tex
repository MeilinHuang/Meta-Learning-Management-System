\section{Assessments}

The main contributions of the Assessment feature include:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Providing convenient quiz creation, usage and submission
	\item Offering useful tools for both staff and students
	\item Aiding students in revising and improving by showing explanations for questions
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Challenges}
The main challenges when implementing the Assessments feature was creating a generic data structure that allows multiple question types to be supported, and providing the ability to change the question type (when creating a question) without causing unexpected issues. This slowed down the progress and as a result, left no time in implementing the re-usability portion of the Quiz feature, and the Poll feature altogether. Due to this, the data structure was re-designed multiple times before it was finalised and was working consistently. This resulted in significant modifications to the Quiz API endpoints being done later than expected (roughly midway through Term 3) and due to technical issues with API requests always being rejected, there was not enough time to implement it into the final implementation.

\subsection{Future Work}
Potential future works for this thesis include:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ability to import existing questions 
	\item Add more question types
	\item Create a statistics page on student attempts
	\item More extensive feedback when a student views their submission
	\item Integration with other features
	\item Improve user interface to be more appealing and easier to use
\end{enumerate}
