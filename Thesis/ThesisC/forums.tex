\section{Forums}
\subsection{Overview}
Forums are a common feature in learning management systems as it provides a community environment where students can ask questions and discuss content with educators and other students.
Many of these built-in forums, however, are very basic and lack sufficient search, sorting and filtering functionality.
In many cases, educators are turning to external, third-party forums in order to take advantage of the more advanced features that they offer.

The aim of this feature is to develop a built-in forum that meets students' and educators' needs so that they no longer need to use an external application.

The forum interface consists of the overview page and the individual post pages.

\subsubsection{Forum Overview Page}

In general, the forum overview page consists of a list of posts, as well as search and filtering mechanisms.
The collapsible filter menu allows users to filter the forum posts based on pre-defined tags.
Forum posts are ordered such that the list of pinned posts are at the top, followed by the remaining posts in chronological order.
Each row in the table includes the post title, date created, number of replies, number of comments and the associated tags.

\end{figure}

Staff have an additional button that allows them to pin and unpin posts.

\subsubsection{Post Page}

\end{figure}

Each forum post has its own post page which contains the post details, responses and comments.
Students are able to edit their posts from the post page if required.
They can easily view the instructor's response, if any, in the responses section.
The comments section allows the author to view and leave any additional comments.
It also gives other students a place to write a response or ask questions based on that forum post.

\end{figure}

If a forum post is unanswered, an admin is able to leave a response.
The current idea is to restrict this so that only Staff can write responses to ensure that all responses are verified.
It also ensures that forum posts aren't left unanswered if a student accidentally leaves a follow-up question in the responses area, instead of the comments section.
This method of implementation may be reassessed if time allows.

\subsection{Additional Features}
As a result of reaching major milestones quicker than expected when building the forum component, additional features were able to be implemented to enhance the functionality and usefulness of the forums.

\subsubsection{Sortable Table}
To provide more methods to help users with finding specific posts, sorting functionality was added to the post tables on the forum overview page.
Users can click on the headings of each column in the table to toggle the sort order based on that heading.
For students, they could use this functionality to find the oldest or latest post in the forums.
Staff could sort the posts by number of replies to find which posts require their attention.
By default, the table is sorted in reverse chronological order based on the date created for each post.

\subsubsection{Upvotes}
An upvote button and count was added to each of the posts on the forum overview page, as well as each individual post page.
Upvoting allows users to like a post to assist in bringing attention to it.
Students could use this functionality to like a post that asks a question that they have been thinking about.
This could help in reducing the number of duplicate or similar posts asked to the forum.
Staff could then sort the posts on the forum overview page by number of upvotes to see which posts are popular amongst students at the moment and require their attention.
Student could also use the upvote count to work out which posts are more important than others.

\subsubsection{Endorsed Posts}
In cases where students leave a comment on a forum post with the correct answer, it was decided that there should be a way for staff to be able to mark this answer as verified so that they don't have to also reply to the post.
An endorse button was added to each comment on the post page for a staff so that they could use it to endorse a comment.
This results in the comment being marked with a green check mark.
The ability for staff to endorse a whole post was also added.
This provides staff with another way to draw attention to important posts.

\subsubsection{Enhanced Filter}
While a filter was always going to be included in the implementation of these forums, it only allowed users to filter posts by the pre-defined tags for the course.
Additional filter options were added to the overall filter to provide users with more ways to find specific posts.
The options added allowed users to filter by posts linked to announcements, answered and unanswered posts, and endorsed posts.

\subsection{Finalised Requirements}
The following features are prioritised using the MoSCoW method which assists in identifying the order in which to implement the requirements. \cite{moscow}
It contains the following priorities

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Must have} - vital features that are critical to the basic functionality of a project.
    \item \textbf{Should have} - important features that aren't critical but add to the basic functionality of a project.
    \item \textbf{Could have} - desired features that aren't necessary to the overall project but can provide a better user experience.
    \item \textbf{Won't have} - low-priority features that likely won't be able to be completed in the given time-frame.
\end{itemize}
