\section{WebCMS}

WebCMS is a LMS designed and used internally for UNSW CSE courses. WebCMS is a browser based LMS that allows unauthenticated users to only see course announcement page and other pages require an authenticated user with correct enrolment access to the course.

\subsection{Enrolments}
WebCMS has a robust enrolment system that is managed by lecturers and course admins. Course Staff creates a course for a specific term and enrols students from enrolment list. Students can be enrolled into multiple courses for each term.

\begin{itemize}
	\item WebCMS has multiple roles that can be assigned to individuals for specific courses (Lecturers, Students, Tutors, Course Admin). Each page in the course can be customised to be accessible by users with specific roles.
	\item Users enrolled into multiple courses will be able to navigate through the courses via the nav bar at top of page. Users can have different roles for each course. (Student in course A and Tutor in course B)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Course Page Feed}
Each Course has a homepage that users will land on when navigating to the course. This main page consists of 3 main components, a static navbar to navigate course content, Course Notices / Announcements and due dates for deliverables.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Course Notices / Announcements can be posted by lecturers or staff member. These posts will automatically generate an email notification to all enrolled users of the course. Posts are visible to all users and provide course wide information like release of assignments and exam information.
	\item Due dates of deliverables are retrieved from quizes and assignments that have a due date set. The panel will show the number of days remaining as well as a link to the specific deliverable.
	\item The static sidebar provides an indexed view of course content. Content links can be grouped under a heading. This allows users to quickly navigate through to the content they are looking for. This sidebar also display the authenticated user's name, role in the course, shortcut links to user's gradebook, wiki and blog.
	\item Course Admins can set course theme color which is propagated through all the above elements as well as throughout all pages for the specific course. Each course can have a different theme color and this helps users differentiate which course they are looking at.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Email Notifications}

\end{itemize}

	\item Pages created can be pinned into the static navbar on the platform for easy access
	\item Pages can be access by direct link to its content resource number that is unique to each page. e.g.https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP9321/21T1/resources/59281
	\item Pages can be embedded with pdf files which provides a basic pdf viewer component so users can view pdfs while remaining on the platform
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
WebCMS is a comprehensive and robust Learning Management System, however it does fall short of some other LMS in the market. WebCMS is not an open source platform that can easily recieve external data or export its own data, it is built as a platform to store / share content but it does not engage students directly with any self serve content like gamification features or self serve modules.
