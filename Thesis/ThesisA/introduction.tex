\section{Aims}

The aims for developing a meta LMS are to provide better flexibility, utility and usability for both course instructors and students. 
Therefore the aims are to develop a LMS that allows instructors to easily curate courses and reuse content and provide students with a high quality learning experience. 
This report has considered a comprehensive set of features that we plan on implementing to achieve these aims. 
These features were developed through analysing other LMSâ€™s which are compiled in our literature review.
The literature review provides a basis in which to analyse other competitors and understand their design principles and implementation.
Through the literature review a set of features for the designed meta LMS are planned in which further the aims for developing a meta LMS.
